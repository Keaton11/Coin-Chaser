You have been stranded on a mysterious land filled with dangerous creatures 
and the only way to find safe passage back home is by collecting 20 coins! I
can't prepare you for the journey to come, but I wish you luck in finding your
way back. To get home, you will traverse the world with the arrow keys or 
WASD keys on your keyboard. Make sure to grab some apples if you're low 
on health or blue orbs to help escape the creatures. Good luck. Great dangers 
lie ahead!!
